                                        through a system <br>to protecting the system itself against certain harms.
                                        Cybersecurity also includes the idea of <br>managing and maintaining trust in information technology products and services.<br>
                                        As such, cybersecurity is an area where computer technologies <br>and methods meet social and ethical concerns.

                                    <h6>Machine learning is a field of computer science that studies how to give computers <br>
                                        the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It can be seen as part <br>
                                        of artificial intelligence, and it has become one of the most important scientific <br>
                                        fields in recent years. Machine learning uses statistical algorithms and requires large <br>
                                        amounts of data to work properly, which makes it one of the most difficult tasks for computers. <br>
                                        The goal is not only help machines do better at making decisions for themselves, <br>
				                     	but also help humans understand those decisions so we can make better predictions too.</h6>

				    <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
				    <h6>The Internet of things is a network, comprised of physical and digital objects <br>
					(embedded or connected to the Internet and typically having sensors) that collect <br>	
					and exchange data through embedded computing systems. The collection of data can <br>
					be used to monitor and control different aspects of these objects by means <br>
					of digital applications. The term "Internet of things" was first coined by <br>
					Kevin Ashton in 1999 as a portmanteau derived from Internet and things, <br>
					but the concept has been further developed as an innovation framework <br>
					for the Internet beyond mere connectivity. The Internet of Things refers to those <br>
					objects that are connected to the Internet, but which are not necessarily computing <br>
					devices such as smartphones, tablets or laptops. </h6>
